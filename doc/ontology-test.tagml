[par n=1>
[s>[persName id->ell01>Ellen<persName] was running up the stairs, and now [persName id->ell01>she<persName]
burst into our room excitedly, with a package in her hand.<s]<par]

[par n=2>[s>[said who->ell01>"Look,
[persName id->mar01>Marion<persName]! Here's your present.<s] [s>[persName id->stv01>He<persName] wouldn't
stop––just left it, and [persName id->stv01>he<persName] said, with such

[par n=3>[s>I opened the package.<s]

[+said>"[persName id->stv01>he<persName] will propose to [persName id->mar01>her<persName], I suppose.
Mama married at sixteen and I suppose [emph>some<emph] people––"<-said] [persName id->ada01>Ada<persName]
